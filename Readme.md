# MyApp

To run the application with full CRUD functionality, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kanhajatthap/Extjs-Todo-App

2. **Frontend Setup**

Navigate to the frontend directory where the app folder is located: 
cd path/to/your/app

Install required dependencies and start the Sencha app:
sencha app watch

Your frontend application will now be running on:
http://localhost:1841/

Note: The frontend will be up and running, but data wonâ€™t appear until the backend is started.

3. **Backend Setup**

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

Start the backend server:
node server.js

The backend server will now be running on:
http://localhost:3000/

4. **Access the Full Application**
Once both frontend and backend servers are running, you can access the full CRUD functionality at:
http://localhost:1841/


This setup will allow you to perform CRUD operations as the frontend is now connected to the backend.
Now everything is in one continuous flow. You can directly copy and paste this entire content into your `README.md` file.
